1. JUNIT : Unit means piece of code, can be method or group of methods that we will test
2. Best practices :
    - Meaningful names
    - Verify only One test condition per test case

3. @Before : Some common stuff required to run before every test case.
             Used if we want to do some kind of setup before test case

4. @After : Runs method after evry test case :
          : Used for any kind of free up or teardown operations

5. @BeforeClass : Operatio ns that need to perform only once at class level and not before every test method.
                : As class level, therefor should be static

6. Array Comparison : assertEquals() always check for object references for array comparison
                      To solve this, use assertArraysEquals()

7. assertArraysEquals() : to compare values of 2 arrays
